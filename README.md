ðŸ“Š Loan Risk Analytics Dashboard

ðŸ§© Problem Statement

Banks and financial institutions face a major challenge in minimizing the risk of losing money while lending to customers. 
It is crucial to assess whether a customer is likely to repay the loan or not before approval.

âœ… Solution

We have developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI that helps decision-makers evaluate a loan applicant's profile. 
The dashboard uses key data insights to identify if an applicant is likely to repay the loan. If the risk is low, the loan
can be approved. If the risk is high, the loan may be declined â€” helping the company reduce financial losses.
